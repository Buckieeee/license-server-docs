## Installation

### Run the installer

Download the installer from [Dynamsoft-Licensing-Tracking-Server](https://tst.dynamsoft.com/public/download/dls/2.2.19/dynamsoft_dls-win_x64-v2.2.19.zip) and unzip to a proper location. In our case, it's unzipped to "E:\dynamsoft_dls-win_x64-v2.2.19".

There are two ways to get the server running. 

* Simply run the batch file "startup.bat"
* Use the tool [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/) to 

We will talk a bit about using NSSM.

* Download [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/ci/nssm-2.24-101-g897c7ad.zip) and unzip, in our case, it's unzipped to "E:\nssm-2.24"
* Open cmd, navigate to the directory "E:\nssm-2.24\win64" (or "E:\nssm-2.24\win32" on a x86 OS) and run the following command

```cmd
nssm install dynamsoft-dls
```

* A GUI will open, fill the parameters for the application like this (change the values according to where you put the files)

  Path: `E:\dynamsoft_dls-win_x64-v2.2.19\win\bin\dynamsoftdlsx.exe`
  Startup directory: `E:\dynamsoft_dls-win_x64-v2.2.19`
  Arguments: `".\win\jre\bin\dynamsoftdls" --add-opens java.base/jdk.internal.loader=ALL-UNNAMED -jar ".\dls-2.2.19.jar" --server.port=48080 --data.port=50201`

  Command: `E:\dynamsoft_dls-win_x64-v2.2.19\shutdown.bat`

* Press the button "Install Service" and you should be able to find dynamsoft-dls as one of the services in the services GUI or in **Task Manager | Service**. If it is not started, start it.

### Test the server

Once the server is running, you can test it via the URL [http://127.0.0.1:48080/page/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:48080/page/index.html).

> If you changed the port during installation, you should use that port instead.

Upon the first visit, you will be asked to set an admin password. After that, you will land on the home page where you can find the UUID of this DLS .

> This UUID is require when [activating your licenses]({{site.selfhosting}}index.html#activate-the-license).

If the above page shows up, then the server is installed correctly and is ready to process requests. However, the requests may not be able to reach it because it only listens on a local IP / Port. Therefore, the next step is to configure the network environment - reverse proxy - for it with the help of `IIS` .
