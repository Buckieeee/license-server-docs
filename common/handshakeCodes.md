# Configure Handshake Codes

Each license key corresponds to a handshake code. In this article, we'll cover the following topics:

* [View existing handshake codes](#view-existing-handshake-codes)
* [Add a handshake code](#add-a-handshake-code)
* [Edit a handshake code](#edit-a-handshake-code)
* [Change license usage order](#change-license-usage-order)
* [View the statistcs of a handshake code](#view-statistics)

## View existing Handshake Codes

A Handshake Code is generated by default for each activated license file when it is imported into DLS. The license file may contain one or multiple License Items. 

On the "HandShake Codes" page, you can see information about the existing HandShake Codes including the names, the license items, the corresponding license key, etc. for each code.

> Although default Handshake Codes are generated per license file, the codes themselves have nothing to do with the license files. In fact, the codes are only related to the license items configured to them and these items can come from any license file that has been imported into DLS.

## Add a Handshake Code

When you add a Handshake Code, you can configure it in a few ways
  
* Assign a string as the name of the Handshake Code. 

  The name of a Handshake Code consists of two parts

  {Dynamsoft ID} - {custom string}

  The first part is your Dynamsoft id and cannot be changed. The second part can be any valid string. For example

  + 216998-100025900
  + 216998-ToUseInApplicationA

* Configure License Items for the Handshake Code

  All activated License Items will show up on the page, you can choose one or multiple items and add it to the Handshake Code.

* Set one or multiple validation field(s) as the binding information.

* Set a Session Password

## Edit a Handshake Code

You can edit any existing Handshake Code, the things you can change are exactly the same as when you [add a Handshake Code](#add-a-handshake-code).

## Change License Usage Order

If multiple License Items are configured to one Handshake Code, the question of which License Item is used first will arise. DLS has a default order which follows these rules

* The one with the closest expiration date is consumed first or
* The one containing the most specific permit is consumed first or
* The one containing the least restrictive permit is consumed first

With the default order, the Handshake Code should be able to take full advantage of all License Items. However, you can still rearrange the order as you see fit by clicking on the button "Change License Usage Order".

## View Statistics

You can click "View Statistics" under a Handshake Code to view its statistics.

On the top of the statistics page, you will see all the License Items configured to this Handshake Code. You can click the id of each License Item to view its own statistics.

Below the License Items, you can see a chart showing usage over a period of time. When you click on a certain date on the chart, you can view detailed usage of that day at the bottom of the page.

> Adding or removing License Items to/from the Handshake Code will not affect the historical figures for that Handshake Code.
